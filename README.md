## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View the current time and location information based on their IP address
- View additional information about the date and time in the expanded state
- Be shown the correct greeting and background image based on the time of day they're visiting the site
- Generate random programming quotes by clicking the refresh icon near the quote

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React-Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

In this project I learned how to use React-Query for fetching data. I don't get the full benefit of it in this project but it was still something I had seen mention and realized it would be good to learn about and use it.

### Continued development

I definitely feel like I need to really continue my learning about animations and the limitations within CSS in regards to what can and cannot have animations affected to them.

### Useful resources

- [Geolocation API](https://docs.abstractapi.com/ip-geolocation) - I ended up using a different api to get location of user since this api has a higher limit for free users.
